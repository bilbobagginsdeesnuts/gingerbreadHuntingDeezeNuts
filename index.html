                Before i had a fridge delivered i used my eski and the vibes of this is the most like "uni student who
                only eats
                cuppa noodles"
        </p>

        <img alt="" src="images/9.jpg">
        <p>Then finally i got the fridge delivered, i felt so bad for these two guys who just fucking lifted it all the
                way up
        </p>

        <img alt="" src="images/10.jpg">

                LAUNDROAMAT - im gonna give a sincere fuck you to the laundromat near my place that takes coins only,
                and
                converted my $20 note to $1 coins. And then the soap machine cost $2 and only took $2 coins

        <p>
                The next weekend i had organised to move an old couch my grandparents gave us into my new place which
                meant i had to clean up
        </p>

        </p>

        <img alt="" src="images/16.jpg">
        <p>
                Then after a night of drinking i drove out to koala’s 2nd hand factory thing with the hope of getting an
                tv
                stand and bookshelf on sale, they had only a short bookshelf for 50% off which i didnt get and now do
                regret but
                also it was such a nightmare to drive out there im not doing that again

                <li>
                        <p><b>Heather's proshoot</b> - This musical is so fun and figuring out the bits inbetween the
                                songs is fun</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <p><b> Talk to me</b> - I don't like horror movies but this was so much fun but also it is set
                                in Adelaide and that's hilarious</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <p><b>Trap</b> - Every character feels like an NPC in a hitman game but also the entire movie
                                feels like a hitman level of the
                                main character trying to break outta a trap and I do like what it's doing</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <p><b>Hundreds of beavers</b> - This slaps, it's an live action looney tunes skit basically but
                                it's just so silly and leans all the way in its
                                basically spinning. Saw it in a packed house at the Orpheum at Cremorne and it was so
                                fucking good with a crowd
                                I would love to watch this again with friends</p>

                                </b> - Stsrkids 3rd in the horror thing, I think it's good. It has a bit of a long run
                                up but once it's gling it's a
                                lot of fun and has some fun callbacks but stands fun on its own</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                        <p><b> A gay eacapade

                                </b> - This is a mash up show of songs from the people who wrote Chicago and their other
                                shows and it was such a fun
                                vibe, they started singing when you're good to muma in the lobby</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                        <p><b> Nyt mini crossword

                                </b> - I've been doing this. Sometimes I'm good and sometimes it's like “the national
                                fish of Oklahoma” and I just give
                                up</p>
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
                anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
                So what's next, I guess in the grand scheme of life the boulder will continue to be pushed up the hill.
                Also I'm
                writing this at a dinner party and some of you reading this are here and anyway the boulder will get up
                there
                one day
